# Pixel to Ascii

This script was created convert a PNG image into ASCII art for the game
"Peasants In a Dungeon". This was an early project that can be done much better.
The script is not very efficient, you need to run it, and copy and paste the output
into your program.

This was recreated for the "LunaSea" text-based project. 

This code is here to show the progress of my skills.
